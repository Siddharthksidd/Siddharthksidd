### Hi, I'm Siddharrth K <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="25px">

I am currently lookingðŸ‘€ for a career transition towards data analytics.
I have also completed the IMB Data Analyst professional certification as my first step for my transition.
I am very much interested to join a team to develope my skillset further more in data analytics. 

I just love the whole process of gathering data from a variety of sources and analysing it to make data driven decisions.
